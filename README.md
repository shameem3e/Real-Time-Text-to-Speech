# 📚 Real Time Text to Speech

A **real-time text-to-speech** system with **dual TTS modes**:
- **pyttsx3** → Fully offline, works without internet
- **gTTS** → Google-powered, high-quality voice (requires internet)

The system:
- Converts typed text into speech instantly
- Allows easy switching between offline and online modes via `config.py`
- Supports custom voice, speed, and language settings
- Saves audio files in `output/` folder when using gTTS

---

## 📌 Features

- 🔊 **Dual Mode** — Choose between:  
  - **Offline Mode (pyttsx3)** — Works without internet, supports multiple voices  
  - **Online Mode (gTTS)** — Natural-sounding voices from Google TTS  
- ⚡ **Instant Playback** — Hear your text immediately after typing  
- 🗂 **Audio File Saving** — gTTS mode saves `.mp3` files in `output/`  
- 🔄 **Easy Switching** — Change modes by editing one line in `config.py`

## ⚙️ Setup Guide

### **1️⃣ Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shameem3e/Real-Time-Text-to-Speech.git
cd Real-Time-Text-to-Speech

```
### **2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

```
### **3️⃣ Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### **4️⃣ Run the project**

[INFO] Mode: PYTTSX
Type 'quit' to exit.

Enter text: 

```

### **✅ Example Output (Offline Mode — pyttsx3)**

You type:
```bash
Hello, this is Shameem.

```

Your computer says:
```bash
hello this is Shameem.

```

### **✅ Example Output (Online Mode — gTTS)**

You type:
```bash
Good morning!

```

* Audio plays instantly
* An MP3 file is saved in:
```bash
output/tts_20250812_143201.mp3

```

## 📜 Code Overview

This project is divided into separate files for clarity and modularity:

### 1. `main.py`
- **Purpose:**  
  The entry point of the project. Reads configuration from `config.py`, accepts user input, and sends it to the selected TTS engine.  
- **Libraries used:**  
  - `config` → Loads mode and settings  
  - `pyttsx_tts` / `gtts_tts` → Calls the chosen TTS engine  
- **Why:**  
  Keeps the program start-up logic clean and switching between engines simple.

---

### 2. `config.py`
- **Purpose:**  
  Stores all configurable settings such as TTS mode, voice, rate, and language.  
- **Libraries used:**  
  None (pure Python variables).  
- **Why:**  
  Centralized configuration makes switching between modes and adjusting parameters easy.

---

### 3. `pyttsx_tts.py`
- **Purpose:**  
  Handles **offline** text-to-speech conversion using `pyttsx3`.  
- **Libraries used:**  
  - `pyttsx3` → Local TTS engine that works without internet  
- **Why:**  
  Works on most systems without requiring internet access, making it ideal for offline use.

---

### 4. `gtts_tts.py`
- **Purpose:**  
  Handles **online** text-to-speech conversion using Google’s TTS API via `gTTS`.  
- **Libraries used:**  
  - `gtts` → Google Text-to-Speech API wrapper  
  - `playsound` → Plays the generated audio  
  - `os`, `datetime` → File handling and timestamping for MP3 saving  
- **Why:**  
  Produces natural-sounding speech with multiple language support.

---

### 5. `output/`
- **Purpose:**  
  Stores `.mp3` audio files generated by `gtts_tts.py`.  
- **Why:**  
  Keeps generated audio organized for later playback or distribution.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q:** Do I need internet for this to work?  
**A:** No, if you use **pyttsx3** mode. Yes, if you use **gTTS** mode.

**Q:** How do I change the voice?  
**A:** For **pyttsx3**, update the `VOICE` variable in `config.py`. For **gTTS**, change the `LANGUAGE` code.

**Q:** Can I adjust the speech speed?  
**A:** Yes — modify `RATE` in `config.py` (pyttsx3 mode).

**Q:** Where are the audio files saved?  
**A:** In the `output/` folder (only when using gTTS mode).

**Q:** Does it work on all operating systems?  
**A:** Yes — it works on Windows, macOS, and Linux (ensure dependencies are installed).

**Q:** Can I use other languages?  
**A:** Yes — set `LANGUAGE` to the desired language code (e.g., `fr` for French, `es` for Spanish).

**Q:** What Python version is required?  
**A:** Python **3.8+** is recommended for compatibility.
